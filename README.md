"Optimizing Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning and Dimensionality Reduction"


## Project Description

Developed a robust credit card fraud detection system by applying machine learning techniques, including PCA for dimensionality reduction and oversampling for handling class imbalance. Evaluated multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM) to optimize detection accuracy, achieving high precision and recall for identifying fraudulent transactions.
## Conclusion

This project focuses on enhancing credit card fraud detection by applying various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. We utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction, oversampling for class balancing, and compared model performances across Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Boosting methods, and Support Vector Machines. PCA proved effective for reducing dataset complexity while maintaining accuracy. Addressing data imbalance was critical, as balanced datasets significantly improved fraud detection rates. Overall, the findings emphasize that tailored preprocessing combined with robust model selection can improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems, with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression yielding the best results in this context.
